# EchoToken
Product Description: EchoToken (aka Token Smith) lets anyone forge ICRC‚Äë2 tokens on ICP with natural‚Äëlanguage commands. Powered by a Fetch.ai agent, users can simply describe the token they want (‚ÄúCreate a token named Banana Coin, ticker BAN, description, website & socials‚Äù) and the system will deploy a new token canister, mint the requested supply, and assign it to the provided principal address. This lowers the barrier to entry for token creation, making Web3 accessible to developers and non‚Äëtechnical users alike.

## Quick Start

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd ic/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

```bash
# uploadwasm

node uploadWasm.mjs
```
## Deploy fetch script

```bash
cd fetch/
```
```bash
python agent.py
```
Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor

## How to Use

Run the agent (python agent.py).

Type your request in plain English, e.g.:

"Create EchoToken with ticker ECHO, supply 5,000,000, 8 decimals, mint to principal‚Äëabc."

The agent will parse the request and call the TokenDeploy canister.

You receive a response with the new token canister ID and a confirmation that tokens were minted to your address.

## User Story

As a creator, I want to type a natural‚Äëlanguage prompt like ‚ÄúCreate Banana Coin (BAN) with 10M supply‚Äù so that I can launch a token without technical knowledge.

As a developer, I want to integrate the Token Smith agent into my app via REST/Agent API so I can automate token deployments programmatically.

As an admin, I want supply thresholds and confirmations to prevent accidental or malicious mega‚Äëminting.
